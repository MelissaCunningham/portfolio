	<quote>We had a great experience with Anderson photography for our wedding.  They took care of organizing all of the extended family and bridal party which was quite a task.  Sarah was able to quickly get to know the wedding event site and spot the best backdrops for photos.  We just love our photos...all 1000 of them! </quote>
